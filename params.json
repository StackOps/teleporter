This tools can be used as a cold or hot migration service. It can run inside a running VM\r\n\r\n## Why Teleporter?\r\nMost of the tools out there are looks really cool but when you try to migrate an existing service to Cloud A to Cloud B you realize that they miss the point: they only migrate the most basic stuff but forget about the tiny little details that locks you inside a Cloud platform.\r\n\r\nThe approach of Teleporter is different: it moves the disk as a whole. The root disk becomes a Golden image, and that Golden image is what you deploy in the StackOps Cloud\r\n\r\n## How to use it\r\nTeleporter it is pretty straight forward. You just need a Linux Operating System with dd and curl installed with access to the net.\r\n\r\nExecute the following command:\r\n***\r\n`curl -L goo.gl/3XmHG4 | sudo sh -s -- STACKOPS_USERNAME STACKOPS_PASSWORD STACKOPS_TENANT <image-name> <device-name>`\r\n***\r\n\r\nOnce executed, the tool will dump the /dev/\\<device-name\\> device or /dev/sda by default to your [stackops](www.stackops.com) Glance account automatically. This process can take several hours since you are moving gigabytes of information, and can be error prone if your network is not very reliable.\r\n\r\n# Cloud Tested\r\n\r\n## Amazon Web Services EC2\r\n\r\n| Image | Did it work? | Post installation notes |\r\n|-------|--------------|-------------------------|\r\n| ubuntu 12.04.4 64bit Server Paravirtual | Yes | No |\r\n\r\n## Digital Ocean\r\n\r\n| Image | Did it work? | Post installation notes |\r\n|-------|--------------|-------------------------|\r\n| ubuntu 12.04.4 Server 64bit | Yes | Network is static.

I don't have it in my VM.\r\nYou don't need it. Teleporter does not use a buffer disk, it stores the information right into our OpenStack Image repository. It can even work with a Read Only file system.\r\n\r\n## Can I run Teleporter inside my running VMs?\r\nYes you can. If your VMs does not write data to disk you can do it safely. If your VMs write data to disk, I recommend to change the runlevel in such a way you don't damage your data.\r\n\r\n## Sounds like magic. Can it work with any Virtual Machine?\r\nNo, it can't, because this is not magic. It's just a little tool that tries to alleviate the pain of changing to a new Cloud Provider.\r\n\r\n## Can I use Teleporter inside a physical server?\r\nSure. Just keep in mind that you will need some drivers that may be they aren't installed in your Operating System. \r\n\r\n## Can I use Teleporter inside a classic Virtual Machine?\r\nSure. Just keep in mind that you will need some drivers that may be they aren't installed in your Operating System. \r\n\r\n## What is the best way to use Teleporter?\r\nIdeally speaking Teleporter should be executed from a Recovery Distro like Knoppix or Clonezilla. But you can launch it from the live Operating System with caution.\r\n\r\n## I have tried the tool inside my server but it says that my Operating System is not supported!\r\nSend us a request with your Operating system and we will change the tool. We try to add it to the tool\r\n\r\n## What is the future of the tool?\r\nIn order to have a fully running VM inside our Cloud there are some post-installations steps to do. We would like to automate them and have a tidy virtual server at the end of the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
